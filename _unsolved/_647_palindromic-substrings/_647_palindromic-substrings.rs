 *
 * Given a string s, return the number of palindromic substrings in it.
 * 
 * A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
 * 
 * A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "abc"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "aaa"
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= s.length <= 1000
 * s consists of lowercase English letters.
