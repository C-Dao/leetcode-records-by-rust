 * Testcase Example:  '4'
 *
 * Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to
 * the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.
 * 
 * You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.
 * 
 * 
 * For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: x = 4
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: x = 8
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down
 * to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 0 <= x <= 2^31 - 1
