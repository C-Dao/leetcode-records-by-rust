 * Testcase Example:  '4\n2'
 *
 * Given two integers n and k, return all possible combinations of k numbers
 * chosen from the range [1, n].
 * 
 * You may return the answer in any order.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 4, k = 2
 * Output: [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]]
 * Explanation: There are 4 choose 2 = 6 total combinations.
 * Note that combinations are unordered, i.e., [1,2] and [2,1] are considered
 * to be the same combination.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 1, k = 1
 * Output: [[1]]
 * Explanation: There is 1 choose 1 = 1 total combination.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= n <= 20
 * 1 <= k <= n
