 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3]\n4'
 *
 * Given an array of distinct integers nums and a target integer target, return
 * the number of possible combinations that add up toÂ target.
 * 
 * The test cases are generated so that the answer can fit in a 32-bit
 * integer.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3], target = 4
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation:
 * The possible combination ways are:
 * (1, 1, 1, 1)
 * (1, 1, 2)
 * (1, 2, 1)
 * (1, 3)
 * (2, 1, 1)
 * (2, 2)
 * (3, 1)
 * Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [9], target = 3
 * Output: 0
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 200
 * 1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
 * All the elements of nums are unique.
 * 1 <= target <= 1000
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up: What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array? How does
 * it change the problem? What limitation we need to add to the question to
 * allow negative numbers?
