 *
 * There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green.
 * The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such
 * that no two adjacent houses have the same color.
 * The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix.
 * For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting
 * house 1 with color green, and so onâ€¦ Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: nums = [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
 * Output: 10
 * Explanation:  Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue. Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 * costs.length == n
 * costs[i].length == 3
 * 1 <= n <= 100
 * 1 <= costs[i][j] <= 20
